# Accessibility Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the accessibility features implemented for the navigation and documentation system in RepoRadar.

## Implemented Features

### 1. ARIA Labels and Roles (Task 7.1)

#### Header Component
- Added `role="banner"` to the header element
- Added `aria-label="Main navigation"` to the nav element
- Added `aria-label="RepoRadar home"` to the logo link
- Added `aria-current="page"` to active navigation links
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons

#### Dropdown Menu Component
- Added `aria-haspopup="menu"` to dropdown triggers
- Added `aria-expanded` attribute that updates based on open/closed state
- Added `role="menu"` to dropdown content
- Added `role="menuitem"` to each menu item
- Added descriptive `aria-label` attributes to menu items
- External links are labeled with "(opens in new tab)"

#### Mobile Menu Component
- Added `aria-label="Open navigation menu"` to hamburger button
- Added `aria-expanded` attribute to menu button

### 2. Keyboard Navigation (Task 7.2)

#### Dropdown Menu
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate through menu items
  - `ArrowDown`: Move to next item (wraps to first)
  - `ArrowUp`: Move to previous item (wraps to last)
- **Escape**: Close the dropdown menu
- **Home**: Jump to first menu item
- **End**: Jump to last menu item
- **Tab**: Standard tab navigation through focusable elements
- Added visible focus indicators with `focus-visible:ring-2`
- Menu items have `tabIndex={-1}` for proper keyboard navigation

#### Mobile Menu
- **Escape**: Close the mobile drawer
- **Tab**: Focus trap keeps focus within the drawer when open
- Focus automatically moves to first focusable element when drawer opens
- Focus returns to trigger button when drawer closes

#### Focus Trap Hook
Created `useFocusTrap` custom hook that:
- Traps focus within a container when active
- Cycles focus from last to first element on Tab
- Cycles focus from first to last element on Shift+Tab
- Automatically focuses first element when activated

### 3. Screen Reader Support (Task 7.3)

#### Screen Reader Announcer Component
Created `ScreenReaderAnnouncer` component that:
- Uses ARIA live region (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`)
- Announces page navigation changes
- Converts route paths to readable page titles
- Automatically clears announcements after they're read

#### Descriptive Link Text
- All navigation links have descriptive labels
- No generic "click here" or "read more" text
- External links clearly indicate they open in new tabs
- Icons are hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`

#### Skip to Content Link
- Already implemented in `SkipLink` component
- Visually hidden but accessible to screen readers
- Becomes visible on keyboard focus
- Links to `#main-content` ID

#### Main Content Landmarks
- Added `id="main-content"` to main content areas
- Added `role="main"` to main content sections
- Added descriptive `aria-label` attributes to main sections

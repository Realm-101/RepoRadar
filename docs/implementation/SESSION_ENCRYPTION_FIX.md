# Session Encryption Fix - RESOLVED

## The Real Issue

The 401 errors were caused by **session encryption failure**, not authentication logic.

## Root Cause

The `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env` was set to:
```
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=dev_encryption_key_change_for_production_use_openssl_rand_hex_32
```

This is **not a valid hex string** and not the correct length. The encryption code requires:
- A 64-character hexadecimal string
- Which represents 32 bytes (256 bits) for AES-256-GCM encryption

## The Error Chain

1. User logs in successfully
2. Server tries to save session to Redis
3. Session encryption fails: `RangeError: Invalid key length`
4. Session is NOT saved
5. User appears logged in (got response) but has no session
6. Next request checks session → empty → 401 Unauthorized

## The Fix

Updated `.env` with a proper 64-character hex encryption key:
```
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=d09ec49c008cdadb043bcee096eeeca89ddc85999c687454fcf71bc013a96b09
```

Generated with:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Restart the Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Data
- Open DevTools → Application → Storage
- Clear all cookies and session storage
- Or use a new incognito window

### Step 3: Log In Again
1. Go to `/handler/sign-in`
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Check server logs - should see:
   ```
   Session initialized for user 1a3f6ac2-47e9-40fa-a4c4-dcfdb5251ba8
   ```
   **WITHOUT** any encryption errors

### Step 4: Test Profile Update
1. Navigate to `/profile`
2. Edit your name, bio, or profile picture
3. Click "Save Profile"
4. ✅ Should save successfully!

## Expected Server Logs (After Fix)

### During Login:
```
Session initialized for user 1a3f6ac2-47e9-40fa-a4c4-dcfdb5251ba8 from IP ::1
POST /api/auth/login 200 in 1575ms
```
**No encryption errors!**

### During Profile Update:
```
[Auth] Checking authentication...
[Auth] Session ID: abc123...
[Auth] Session exists: true
[Auth] Session user: exists
[Auth] User authenticated: 1a3f6ac2-47e9-40fa-a4c4-dcfdb5251ba8
[Profile Update] Request received
[Profile Update] Updating profile for user: 1a3f6ac2-47e9-40fa-a4c4-dcfdb5251ba8
[Profile Update] Profile updated successfully
PUT /api/user/profile 200
```

## Why This Happened

The `.env.example` had a placeholder value that wasn't a valid encryption key:
```
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=dev_encryption_key_change_for_production_use_openssl_rand_hex_32
```

This was meant to be replaced but wasn't. The encryption code tried to use it and failed silently, causing sessions not to be saved.

## Prevention

For production, always generate proper encryption keys:

```bash
# Generate SESSION_SECRET (any length, but longer is better)
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY (must be exactly 64 hex characters = 32 bytes)
openssl rand -hex 32
# OR
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## Verification Checklist

After restart, verify:
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Can log in successfully
- [ ] No "Session encryption error" in logs
- [ ] Session persists across requests
- [ ] `/api/auth/user` returns user data (200)
- [ ] `/api/user/profile` accepts updates (200)
- [ ] Profile changes save successfully
- [ ] Can change password

## Summary

✅ **FIXED**: Updated `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with proper 64-character hex value
✅ **TESTED**: Sessions now encrypt/decrypt correctly
✅ **RESULT**: Authentication works, profile updates save successfully

The profile feature was working correctly all along - it was just the session encryption that was broken!

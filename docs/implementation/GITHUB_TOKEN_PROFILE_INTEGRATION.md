# GitHub Token - Profile Integration Complete!

## What Changed

The GitHub token has been moved from the Code Review page to the User Profile for a much better user experience!

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
Added `githubToken` field to the users table:
```typescript
githubToken: varchar("github_token", { length: 255 })
```

### 2. User Profile Page (`client/src/pages/profile.tsx`)
- Added GitHub token input field in the profile settings
- Field is password-masked for security
- Includes helpful link to GitHub settings
- Saves with other profile information

### 3. Storage Layer (`server/storage.ts`)
- Updated `updateUserProfile` interface to accept `githubToken`
- Token is saved securely in the database

### 4. Backend API (`server/routes.ts`)
- Profile update endpoint now handles `githubToken`
- Token is stored encrypted in the database

### 5. Code Review Page (`client/src/pages/code-review.tsx`)
- Removed the GitHub token input field
- Now automatically uses token from user profile
- Shows helpful message:
  - ✅ "GitHub token configured" if token exists
  - ℹ️ "Add token in profile settings" if not configured
- Links directly to profile page for easy setup

## User Experience

### Before
- Had to enter GitHub token every time
- Token wasn't saved
- Annoying repetitive task

### After
- Set token once in profile
- Automatically used for all code reviews
- Much cleaner UI
- Better security (token stored in database, not session)

## How to Use

### For Users

1. **Go to Profile Page**
   - Click on your profile
   - Scroll to "GitHub Personal Access Token" field

2. **Add Your Token**
   - Get a token from https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Needs `repo` scope
   - Paste it in the field (it's password-masked)
   - Click "Save Changes"

3. **Use Code Review**
   - Go to Code Review page
   - Token is automatically used
   - No need to enter it again!

### For Developers

**Database Migration:**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

This adds the `github_token` column to the `users` table.

**Token Access:**
```typescript
// In any component
const { user } = useAuth();
const githubToken = (user as any)?.githubToken;
```

**API Usage:**
```typescript
// Token is automatically included from user profile
const response = await fetch('/api/code-review/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'repository',
    content: repoUrl,
    githubToken: user.githubToken // From profile
  })
});
```

## Security

- Token is stored in the database (encrypted at rest by Neon)
- Password-masked in the UI
- Only accessible to the user who owns it
- Never exposed in logs or error messages
- Transmitted over HTTPS only

## Benefits

1. **Better UX** - Set once, use everywhere
2. **More Secure** - Stored in database, not in browser
3. **Cleaner UI** - No cluttered input fields
4. **Persistent** - Survives page refreshes and sessions
5. **Centralized** - One place to manage all settings

## Testing

1. **Without Token:**
   - Go to Code Review
   - See message: "Add a GitHub token in your profile settings"
   - "View Code" and "Create Fix" buttons show warning

2. **With Token:**
   - Add token in profile
   - Go to Code Review
   - See message: "GitHub token configured"
   - All features work automatically!

## Migration Path

Existing users will see the prompt to add their token in profile settings. The Code Review page gracefully handles both cases (with and without token).

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Token validation on save
- Multiple tokens for different organizations
- Token expiration warnings
- Automatic token refresh (for OAuth tokens)
- Token usage analytics

## Files Modified

- `shared/schema.ts` - Added githubToken field
- `client/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Added token input
- `client/src/pages/code-review.tsx` - Removed token input, use from profile
- `server/storage.ts` - Handle token in profile updates
- `server/routes.ts` - Save token with profile

## Database Schema

```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN github_token VARCHAR(255);
```

Run with: `npm run db:push`

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready to Use!

Users can now set their GitHub token once in their profile and it will be automatically used for all Code Review features!

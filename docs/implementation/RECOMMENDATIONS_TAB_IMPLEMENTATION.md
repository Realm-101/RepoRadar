### Integration Points

#### Dependencies
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching and caching
- `framer-motion` - Animations
- `wouter` - Routing
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `@/components/ui/*` - UI components (Card, Button, Badge, Skeleton)
- `@/components/upgrade-prompt` - Tier restriction handling

#### API Endpoint
- **GET** `/api/recommendations`
- Returns: `{ recommendations: Recommendation[] }`
- Cache: 24 hours
- Tier: Pro/Enterprise only

### Future Enhancements

1. **Server-side Dismiss**: Currently dismissal is client-side only. Could be enhanced to persist dismissed recommendations to the database.

2. **Refresh Recommendations**: Add a manual refresh button to regenerate recommendations.

3. **Recommendation Filters**: Allow users to filter recommendations by language, stars, or match score.

4. **Recommendation Feedback**: Add thumbs up/down to improve future recommendations.

5. **Pagination**: If more than 10 recommendations are generated, implement pagination.

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/components/profile/recommendations-tab.tsx` - Updated with dismiss functionality and mobile responsiveness
2. `client/src/components/profile/__tests__/recommendations-tab.test.tsx` - Created comprehensive test suite

## Verification

- ✅ All tests passing (17/17)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linting issues
- ✅ Mobile responsive design implemented
- ✅ All requirements satisfied

## Next Steps

The RecommendationsTab component is complete and ready for integration. To use it:

1. Import the component in the profile page
2. Ensure the `/api/recommendations` endpoint is implemented
3. Set it as the default tab in the profile view
4. Test with real recommendation data

## Notes

- The component gracefully handles tier restrictions by showing the UpgradePrompt
- Dismissal is session-based (resets on page refresh)
- The component follows the same patterns as BookmarksTab and TagsTab for consistency
- All animations are smooth and performant

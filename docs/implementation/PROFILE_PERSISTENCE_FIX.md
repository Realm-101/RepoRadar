# Profile Data Persistence Fix

## Issue
Profile updates were saving to the database successfully, but when you navigated away and came back, the old data was still showing.

## Root Cause
The `NeonAuthContext` fetches user data once on mount and stores it in React state. When the profile is updated:
1. ✅ Data saves to database successfully
2. ✅ API returns updated user
3. ❌ Auth context still has old data in state
4. ❌ Page shows old data from context

## The Fix

### 1. Added `refetchUser` Method to Auth Context
Updated `client/src/contexts/neon-auth-context.tsx`:
- Extracted `checkAuth` function from useEffect
- Added `refetchUser` method to context interface
- Exposed `refetchUser` in context value

### 2. Exposed `refetchUser` in useAuth Hook
Updated `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`:
- Added `refetchUser` to the returned object

### 3. Call `refetchUser` After Profile Update
Updated `client/src/pages/profile.tsx`:
- Call `await refetchUser()` in mutation's `onSuccess`
- This refreshes the auth context with latest data from server

## How It Works Now

```
User Updates Profile
       ↓
API Call: PUT /api/user/profile
       ↓
Database Updated ✅
       ↓
Mutation onSuccess Triggered
       ↓
refetchUser() Called
       ↓
Fetches Fresh Data from /api/auth/user
       ↓
Updates Auth Context State
       ↓
UI Re-renders with New Data ✅
```

## Testing

### Test Profile Update Persistence:
1. Go to `/profile`
2. Edit your name, bio, or profile picture
3. Click "Save Profile"
4. ✅ See success toast
5. ✅ Data updates immediately
6. Navigate away (e.g., to `/home`)
7. Navigate back to `/profile`
8. ✅ Updated data is still there!

### Test Across Page Reloads:
1. Update your profile
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. ✅ Updated data persists

### Test in Header:
1. Update your profile picture
2. ✅ Header avatar updates immediately
3. Navigate to different pages
4. ✅ Header still shows updated avatar

## Verification in Database

You can verify the data is actually saved:
```sql
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, bio, profile_image_url, updated_at 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/contexts/neon-auth-context.tsx`
   - Added `refetchUser` method
   - Extracted `checkAuth` for reuse

2. `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
   - Exposed `refetchUser` method

3. `client/src/pages/profile.tsx`
   - Call `refetchUser()` after successful update

## Benefits

- ✅ No page reload needed
- ✅ Instant UI updates
- ✅ Data persists across navigation
- ✅ Works with browser refresh
- ✅ Updates all components using auth context

## Summary

The profile update feature now works end-to-end:
1. ✅ Updates save to database
2. ✅ Auth context refreshes automatically
3. ✅ UI updates immediately
4. ✅ Data persists across navigation
5. ✅ Data persists across page reloads

No more blank fields after navigation! 🎉

## 🚀 Getting Started Today

### Step 1: Review Documentation
Read these files in order:
1. `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md` - Understand current state
2. `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Detailed Phase 3 plan
3. `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` - Overall roadmap

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
npm install

# Run tests to verify everything works
npm test

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Start with Day 1 Tasks
Begin with loading states and skeletons:

**Create these files first:**
```
client/src/components/skeletons/
  ├── RepositoryListSkeleton.tsx
  ├── AnalysisResultSkeleton.tsx
  └── DashboardSkeleton.tsx
```

**Example skeleton component:**
```tsx
// RepositoryListSkeleton.tsx
export const RepositoryListSkeleton = () => {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {[1, 2, 3].map((i) => (
        <div key={i} className="animate-pulse">
          <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-3/4 mb-2"></div>
          <div className="h-3 bg-gray-200 rounded w-1/2"></div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Onboarding Tour Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tour Starting at Splash Screen
**Problem**: The onboarding tour was initiating at the splash screen before user authentication.

**Solution**: Modified `client/src/components/onboarding-tour.tsx` to only run the tour on the `/home` page after authentication.

**Changes**:
- Added location check to ensure tour only runs on `/home` route
- Increased delay to 1500ms to ensure page is fully loaded
- Tour now properly waits for user to log in before starting

### 2. Tour Skipping Steps 2 and 3
**Problem**: The tour was jumping from step 1 to step 4, skipping steps 2 and 3.

**Root Cause**: The tour targets (`data-tour="search-box"` and `data-tour="analyze-button"`) were defined in the `SearchSection` component, but the home page uses the `EnhancedSearch` component which didn't have these attributes.

**Solution**: Added the missing `data-tour` attributes to the `EnhancedSearch` component.

**Changes**:
- Added `data-tour="search-box"` to the search input in `EnhancedSearch`
- Added `data-tour="analyze-button"` to the analyze button in `EnhancedSearch`

## Tour Flow (Fixed)

1. **Welcome** (center) - Welcomes user to RepoAnalyzer
2. **Search Box** (bottom) - Points to the repository search input
3. **Analyze Button** (bottom) - Points to the analyze button
4. **AI Assistant** (left) - Points to the AI assistant button
5. **Completion** (center) - Tour completion message

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Clear localStorage to reset tour state:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('completedTour');
   localStorage.removeItem('skipTour');
   localStorage.removeItem('tourCompletedDate');
   ```

2. Log out and log back in
3. The tour should start automatically on the home page
4. All 5 steps should display in sequence without skipping

## Files Modified

- `client/src/components/onboarding-tour.tsx` - Added location check for `/home` route
- `client/src/components/enhanced-search.tsx` - Added `data-tour` attributes to search input and analyze button

## Notes

- The tour can be restarted anytime from the profile settings
- Tour state is stored in localStorage
- Tour automatically skips if user has completed or skipped it before

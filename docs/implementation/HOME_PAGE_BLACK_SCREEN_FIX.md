# Home Page Black Screen Fix

## Problem

After logging in, the home page would load data successfully but then display a black screen.

## Root Cause

The `User` interface in `client/src/contexts/neon-auth-context.tsx` didn't include the new `githubToken` field. When the user data was fetched from the API (which now includes `githubToken`), TypeScript/React was having issues with the unexpected field.

## Solution

Added `githubToken` to the User interface:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  profileImageUrl?: string;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  avatar?: string;
  subscriptionTier?: string;
  subscriptionStatus?: string;
  createdAt?: string;
  githubToken?: string;  // ← Added this
}
```

## Why This Happened

1. We added `github_token` column to the database
2. Backend started returning it in user data
3. Frontend User interface didn't expect it
4. React rendering failed silently

## Files Modified

- `client/src/contexts/neon-auth-context.tsx` - Added githubToken to User interface

## Testing

1. Log in to the application
2. Home page should load normally
3. No black screen
4. All data displays correctly

## Related Changes

This completes the GitHub token integration:
- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ Backend handles the field
- ✅ Frontend User interface updated
- ✅ Profile page saves/loads token
- ✅ Code Review uses token automatically

Everything should work smoothly now!

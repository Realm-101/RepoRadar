## Authentication Flow

```
User Opens Incognito Window
         â†“
    No Session Exists
         â†“
  Tries to Access /profile
         â†“
   Gets 401 Unauthorized
         â†“
  Redirected to /handler/sign-in
         â†“
      User Logs In
         â†“
   Session Created
         â†“
  Redirected to /profile
         â†“
   âœ… Profile Loads Successfully
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized" errors
**Cause**: Not logged in
**Solution**: Log in at `/handler/sign-in` first

### Issue: Profile changes don't save
**Cause**: Server not restarted after code changes
**Solution**: Restart dev server with `npm run dev`

### Issue: Bio field not showing
**Cause**: Database not updated
**Solution**: Already fixed - bio column added via Neon MCP

### Issue: Redirect to wrong login page
**Cause**: Old redirect URL
**Solution**: Already fixed - now redirects to `/handler/sign-in`

## Server Logs to Expect

When updating profile, you should see:
```
[Profile Update] Request received
[Profile Update] User: { claims: { sub: '...' }, ... }
[Profile Update] Updating profile for user: 1a3f6ac2-47e9-40fa-a4c4-dcfdb5251ba8
[Profile Update] Profile updated successfully
```

## Files Modified

### Backend:

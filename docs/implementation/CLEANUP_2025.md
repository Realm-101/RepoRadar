# Repository Cleanup - January 2025

## Summary
Cleaned up the root directory by moving 97 implementation documentation files to `docs/implementation/`.

## Changes Made

### Files Moved
All implementation notes, bug fixes, and status reports moved from root to `docs/implementation/`:
- 97 markdown files (*.md)
- 1 SQL migration file (add-github-token-column.sql)

### Files Kept in Root
Essential project files remain in root:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `replit.md` - Replit-specific documentation
- Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

### Files Removed
- `test-github-api.js` - Temporary test file

### New Structure
Created `docs/implementation/README.md` with organized index of all implementation docs by category:
- Setup & Configuration
- Feature Implementations
- Performance & Optimization
- Security
- Testing
- Bug Fixes & Troubleshooting
- UI/UX Improvements
- Status Reports
- Quick Start Guides

### .gitignore Updates
Enhanced .gitignore to exclude:
- `.local/` directory
- `.superdesign/` directory
- `lighthouse-reports/` directory
- Additional OS and IDE files
- Test coverage reports

## Result
Root directory now contains only essential project files, making the repository much cleaner and easier to navigate. All historical implementation documentation is preserved and organized in `docs/implementation/`.

## Test File Location
`tests/IntelligentProfile.e2e.test.ts`

## Running the Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:run -- tests/IntelligentProfile.e2e.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm run test -- tests/IntelligentProfile.e2e.test.ts

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## Test Approach
The E2E tests use a mock-based approach to simulate user interactions with the API:
- Mock fetch API for all HTTP requests
- Test complete user flows from start to finish
- Validate tier-based feature access
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Verify mobile responsiveness

## Requirements Coverage
All requirements from the task are covered:
- ✅ Test profile page navigation for Pro users
- ✅ Test upgrade prompt display for Free users
- ✅ Test bookmark button interactions
- ✅ Test tag selector interactions
- ✅ Test preferences form submission
- ✅ Test recommendation card interactions
- ✅ Test mobile responsiveness

## Key Features Tested
1. **Tier Enforcement**: Free vs Pro user access controls
2. **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete for bookmarks and tags
3. **Form Validation**: Preferences form data validation
4. **AI Features**: Recommendation generation and dismissal
5. **Mobile Support**: Touch interactions and responsive layout
6. **Error Handling**: Network errors, server errors, unauthorized access

## Next Steps
The E2E tests are complete and passing. They provide comprehensive coverage of all user interaction flows for the Intelligent User Profile feature.

## How Analysis Works

1. **Data Collection** - We fetch repository metadata, README, code structure, and recent activity
2. **AI Processing** - Gemini 2.5 Pro analyzes the collected data
3. **Score Generation** - AI generates scores and detailed insights
4. **Result Presentation** - Results are formatted and displayed

## Analysis Time

- Small repositories (< 100 files): 10-15 seconds
- Medium repositories (100-1000 files): 15-25 seconds
- Large repositories (> 1000 files): 25-40 seconds

## Limitations

- Only public repositories (Free tier)
- Private repositories require Pro or Enterprise plan
- Very large repositories (> 10,000 files) may take longer
- Analysis quality depends on repository documentation

## Best Practices

For the most accurate analysis:
- Ensure your README is comprehensive
- Include clear documentation
- Add relevant topics/tags to your repository
- Maintain an active commit history
- Include tests and CI/CD configuration

# HTTPS Enforcement and Security Headers Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive HTTPS enforcement and security headers middleware to protect the application from common web vulnerabilities and ensure secure communication.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. HTTPS Enforcement Middleware (`server/middleware/httpsEnforcement.ts`)

**Features:**
- Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect in production (301 permanent redirect)
- Environment-aware: skips redirect in development for local testing
- Supports various proxy configurations (x-forwarded-proto header)
- Logging for monitoring redirect activity

**How it works:**
- Checks if request is already HTTPS
- In production, redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS
- In development, allows HTTP for local testing

### 2. Security Headers Middleware

**Implemented Headers:**

1. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**
   - `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
   - Forces browsers to use HTTPS for 1 year
   - Only enabled in production

2. **X-Content-Type-Options**
   - `nosniff`
   - Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks

3. **X-Frame-Options**
   - `DENY`
   - Prevents clickjacking attacks

4. **X-XSS-Protection**
   - `1; mode=block`
   - Enables browser XSS protection (legacy browsers)

5. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**
   - Restricts resource loading to prevent XSS
   - Allows necessary external resources (Google OAuth, GitHub API, fonts)
   - More permissive in development for hot reload
   - Includes `upgrade-insecure-requests` in production

6. **Referrer-Policy**
   - `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
   - Controls referrer information sent with requests

7. **Permissions-Policy**
   - Disables unnecessary browser features (geolocation, microphone, camera, payment)

### 3. Enhanced Session Cookie Configuration

**Updated `server/sessionStore.ts`:**
- `secure: true` in production (HTTPS only)
- `httpOnly: true` (prevents XSS attacks)
- `sameSite: 'strict'` in production (prevents CSRF attacks)
- `sameSite: 'lax'` in development (allows OAuth flows)
- `path: '/'` (cookie available for entire domain)
- `domain` configurable via environment variable in production

### 4. Middleware Integration

**Updated `server/index.ts`:**
- Applied security middleware at the top of the middleware stack
- Ensures all requests are protected before any processing
- Order: HTTPS enforcement → Security headers → Body parsing → Other middleware

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Added to `.env.example`:
```bash
# HTTPS and Security Configuration
FORCE_HTTPS=true
COOKIE_DOMAIN=
```

### Existing Variables Used:
- `NODE_ENV` - Determines production vs development behavior
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption secret
- `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - Session data encryption key

## Security Benefits

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - All traffic encrypted in transit
   - Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Protects sensitive data (passwords, tokens, session cookies)

2. **HSTS**
   - Prevents SSL stripping attacks
   - Forces HTTPS even if user types http://
   - Protects against protocol downgrade attacks

3. **CSP**
   - Prevents XSS attacks
   - Restricts inline scripts and styles
   - Controls resource loading sources

4. **Cookie Security**
   - `secure` flag prevents cookie transmission over HTTP
   - `httpOnly` prevents JavaScript access to cookies
   - `sameSite: strict` prevents CSRF attacks

5. **Additional Headers**
   - Prevents clickjacking (X-Frame-Options)
   - Prevents MIME sniffing (X-Content-Type-Options)
   - Enables browser XSS protection (X-XSS-Protection)

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Development Mode:**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=development npm run dev
   ```
   - HTTP should work on localhost
   - Security headers should be present (except HSTS)
   - CSP should allow hot reload

2. **Production Mode:**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```
   - HTTP requests should redirect to HTTPS
   - All security headers should be present
   - Strict CSP should be enforced

### Verification

Check headers using browser DevTools or curl:
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```

Expected headers:
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (production only)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Content-Security-Policy: ...`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: ...`

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **5.1** - HTTPS enforcement in production  
✅ **5.2** - HTTP to HTTPS redirect  
✅ **5.3** - Secure cookie flag in production  
✅ **5.4** - HSTS and security headers  
✅ **5.5** - SameSite attribute for CSRF protection  
✅ **5.6** - Environment-aware configuration  
✅ **5.7** - Comprehensive security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. **SSL/TLS Certificate Setup**
   - Obtain SSL certificate for production domain
   - Configure certificate in hosting environment
   - Verify TLS 1.2+ is enabled

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor HTTPS redirect logs
   - Track CSP violations
   - Monitor cookie security flags

3. **Testing**
   - Test OAuth flows with strict SameSite
   - Verify all external resources load correctly with CSP
   - Test on various browsers

## Notes

- HTTPS enforcement only applies in production to allow local development
- CSP is more permissive in development to support hot reload
- Cookie `sameSite` is 'lax' in development to support OAuth flows
- All security features are environment-aware and production-ready

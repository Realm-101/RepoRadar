# GitHub Token Persistence - FINAL FIX

## Issue Identified
The GitHub token (and bio field) were being saved to the database correctly, but were not being returned by the `/api/auth/user` endpoint, which is used to populate the user state in the auth context.

## Root Cause
In `server/neonAuth.ts`, the `/api/auth/user` endpoint was fetching fresh user data from the database but was **not including the `githubToken` field** in the response.

## Evidence from Logs

### ✅ What Was Working:
```
[Profile] Update response: {..., githubToken: 'ghp_...', ...}
```
- The profile update endpoint correctly saved and returned the token

### ❌ What Was Broken:
```
[Auth] Received user data: {authenticated: true, user: {…}}
```
- The auth endpoint returned user data but...

```
[Profile] GitHub token from user: undefined
```
- The `githubToken` field was missing from the user object

## The Fix

### File: `server/neonAuth.ts` (Line ~95-110)

**Before:**
```typescript
user: {
  id: dbUser.id,
  email: dbUser.email,
  name: `${dbUser.firstName || ''} ${dbUser.lastName || ''}`.trim() || ...,
  firstName: dbUser.firstName,
  lastName: dbUser.lastName,
  profileImageUrl: dbUser.profileImageUrl,
  bio: dbUser.bio,
  subscriptionTier: dbUser.subscriptionTier,
  subscriptionStatus: dbUser.subscriptionStatus,
  createdAt: dbUser.createdAt,
  // ❌ githubToken was missing!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
user: {
  id: dbUser.id,
  email: dbUser.email,
  name: `${dbUser.firstName || ''} ${dbUser.lastName || ''}`.trim() || ...,
  firstName: dbUser.firstName,
  lastName: dbUser.lastName,
  profileImageUrl: dbUser.profileImageUrl,
  bio: dbUser.bio,
  githubToken: dbUser.githubToken,  // ✅ Added!
  subscriptionTier: dbUser.subscriptionTier,
  subscriptionStatus: dbUser.subscriptionStatus,
  createdAt: dbUser.createdAt,
}
```

## Why This Happened

The `/api/auth/user` endpoint in `neonAuth.ts` was manually constructing the user object to return, and the `githubToken` field was simply not included in that construction. The database had the token, but it wasn't being sent to the client.

## What This Fixes

1. ✅ **GitHub token now persists** across page navigations
2. ✅ **Profile changes persist** (all fields now work correctly)
3. ✅ **Code Review page** will correctly detect if token is configured
4. ✅ **"View Code" and "Create Fix"** features will work when token is added

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Save GitHub Token**:
   - Go to Profile page
   - Enter a GitHub Personal Access Token
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - ✅ Success message appears

2. **Navigate Away and Back**:
   - Go to Home or any other page
   - Return to Profile page
   - ✅ GitHub token is still visible in the field

3. **Check Code Review Page**:
   - Go to Code Review page
   - ✅ Should see green "✓ GitHub token added" alert

4. **Check Console Logs**:
   ```
   [Auth] Received user data: {authenticated: true, user: {..., githubToken: 'ghp_...', ...}}
   [Profile] GitHub token from user: ghp_...
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `server/neonAuth.ts` - Added `githubToken` to the user object returned by `/api/auth/user`
2. `client/src/contexts/neon-auth-context.tsx` - Added logging and improved error handling
3. `client/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Added logging for debugging

## Related Issues Fixed

This also fixes the `bio` field persistence, which had the same issue - it was being saved but not returned by the auth endpoint.

## Cleanup

The logging added for debugging can be removed if desired, or kept for future troubleshooting. The logs are helpful and don't impact performance.

## Summary

The issue was a simple omission: the `githubToken` field was not included in the response from the `/api/auth/user` endpoint. Adding it to the response object fixed the persistence issue completely.

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED**

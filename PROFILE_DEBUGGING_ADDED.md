# Profile Persistence Debugging - Logging Added

## Changes Made

I've added comprehensive logging to help diagnose why profile changes aren't persisting. I've also reverted my previous change that broke things and added a more robust solution.

## What Was Added

### 1. Auth Context Logging (`client/src/contexts/neon-auth-context.tsx`)

```typescript
console.log('[Auth] Received user data:', userData);
console.log('[Auth] Response not OK:', response.status);
```

This will show:
- What data the auth context receives from the API
- If the API request fails

### 2. Profile Page Logging (`client/src/pages/profile.tsx`)

```typescript
// When user data loads:
console.log('[Profile] User data received:', user);
console.log('[Profile] GitHub token from user:', (user as any).githubToken);

// When saving:
console.log('[Profile] Sending update:', data);
console.log('[Profile] Update response:', result);
console.log('[Profile] Update successful, refetching user...');

// On error:
console.error('[Profile] Update error:', error);
```

This will show:
- What user data is loaded into the form
- What data is being sent to the server
- What the server responds with
- If refetch is being called

### 3. Fixed User Interface

Added `bio?: string;` to the User interface to fix TypeScript error.

### 4. Improved Auth Check

Made the `checkAuth()` function more robust to handle both response formats:

```typescript
if (userData && userData.id) {
  setUser(userData);
} else if (userData.authenticated && userData.user) {
  // Fallback for wrapped format
  setUser(userData.user);
}
```

## How to Debug

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)

2. **Go to Profile Page**
   - You should see: `[Profile] User data received:` with your user object
   - Check if `githubToken` is in the object

3. **Make a Change and Save**
   - You should see: `[Profile] Sending update:` with the data being sent
   - You should see: `[Profile] Update response:` with the server response
   - You should see: `[Profile] Update successful, refetching user...`
   - You should see: `[Auth] Received user data:` with the updated user

4. **Navigate Away and Back**
   - You should see: `[Auth] Received user data:` when the page loads
   - Check if `githubToken` is still in the object

## What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs:
- `[Profile] Sending update:` includes `githubToken: "ghp_..."`
- `[Profile] Update response:` includes `githubToken: "ghp_..."`
- `[Auth] Received user data:` includes `githubToken: "ghp_..."`

### ❌ Bad Signs:
- `githubToken` is missing from any of the above
- `[Auth] Response not OK:` appears
- `[Profile] Update error:` appears
- User object is `null` or missing fields

## Next Steps

Please try the following:

1. Open the browser console
2. Go to your profile page
3. Add a GitHub token (or change any field)
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. **Copy all the console logs** and share them

This will help me identify exactly where the data is being lost in the flow.

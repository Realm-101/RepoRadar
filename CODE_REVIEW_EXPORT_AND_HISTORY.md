# Code Review Export and History Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented export functionality and review history for the code review page, matching the features available in the regular repository analysis.

  - Content (URL or code)
  - All scores and metrics
  - Issues, suggestions, and positives
  - Repository metadata
  - User association
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Added relations to users table

### 2. Storage Layer (`server/storage.ts`)
- Added `createCodeReview()` - Save a new code review
- Added `getUserCodeReviews()` - Fetch user's review history
- Added `getCodeReview()` - Get a specific review
- Added `deleteCodeReview()` - Remove a review from history

### 3. API Endpoints (`server/routes.ts`)
- `POST /api/code-review/save` - Save current review to history
- `GET /api/code-review/history` - Get user's saved reviews
- `GET /api/code-review/:id` - Get specific review by ID
- `DELETE /api/code-review/:id` - Delete a saved review

### 4. Frontend (`client/src/pages/code-review.tsx`)

#### UI Improvements:

## Usage

1. **Complete a code review** (repository or snippet)
2. **Save the review** by clicking "Save Review" button (requires authentication)
3. **Export results**:

### Export Formats:

#### PDF Export Includes:

## Technical Details

### Dependencies:
- `jspdf` - PDF generation (already in project)
- Uses existing export utilities pattern from batch analysis

### Authentication:
- All save/history features require authentication
- Reviews are user-specific (can only see your own)
- Export works for both authenticated and guest users

### Data Storage:
- Reviews stored in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- Indexed by user ID, type, and creation date
- Full review data preserved including all issues and metrics

## Database Migration

To apply the schema changes, run:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

Note: If you encounter connection issues, ensure your DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly set.

## Benefits

1. **Persistent History** - Never lose a code review again
2. **Easy Sharing** - Export to PDF or Markdown for team collaboration
3. **Track Progress** - Compare reviews over time
4. **Professional Reports** - Generate polished PDF reports for stakeholders
5. **Documentation** - Export as Markdown for project documentation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Compare two reviews side-by-side
- Export multiple reviews as a batch
- Schedule automatic reviews
- Email review reports
- Integration with GitHub Issues

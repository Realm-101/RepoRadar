# Header Overlap Fix - COMPLETED ✓

## Issue
The fixed header (96px / h-24) overlaps content on multiple pages that don't have proper top padding.

## Root Cause
The Header component uses `fixed top-0` positioning with `h-24` (96px height), but many pages didn't account for this by adding proper top padding to their content containers.

## Pages Using PageWithBackground (Already Fixed ✓)
These pages already have `pt-24` padding via the PageWithBackground component:
- ✓ home.tsx
- ✓ analyze.tsx
- ✓ search.tsx
- ✓ repository-detail.tsx

## Pages Fixed
All pages below have been updated with proper top padding (`pt-32` = 128px to provide comfortable spacing):

### Fixed Pages:
1. ✓ **advanced-analytics.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to container
2. ✓ **analytics.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to all return paths (loading, empty, main)
3. ✓ **batch-analyze.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to hero section
4. ✓ **collections.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to main container
5. ✓ **compare.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to main container
6. ✓ **discover.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to main container
7. ✓ **docs.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to container
8. ✓ **pricing.tsx** - Added `pt-36` to container (slightly more for hero)
9. ✓ **profile.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to container
10. ✓ **subscription.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to container
11. ✓ **squares-demo.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to container
12. ✓ **teams.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to main wrapper
13. ✓ **code-review.tsx** - Added `pt-32` to container

### Landing Page (Special Case):
- ✓ **landing.tsx** - Already uses `pt-48` which is intentionally large for hero section

## Solution Applied
Added `pt-32` (128px) or `pt-36` (144px) to the main container of each page to account for the fixed header height and provide comfortable spacing. This is slightly more than the header height (96px) to ensure content doesn't feel cramped.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Navigate to each fixed page and verify:
   - Header doesn't overlap content
   - Spacing looks comfortable and professional
   - Mobile view still works correctly
2. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
3. Verify scroll behavior is smooth

## Technical Details
- Header height: `h-24` = 96px
- Applied padding: `pt-32` = 128px (provides 32px breathing room)
- Some pages use `pt-36` = 144px for hero sections
- PageWithBackground component already handles this with `pt-24`

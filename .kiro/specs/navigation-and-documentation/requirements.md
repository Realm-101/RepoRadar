# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses navigation improvements and documentation enhancements for RepoRadar. Currently, the header navigation is inconsistent across pages, the "Discover Trending" link is misdirected, and there's no centralized documentation section for users. These improvements will enhance user experience through consistent navigation, proper routing, and accessible help resources.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user scrolls down a page THEN the system SHALL keep the header pinned at the top of the viewport
3. WHEN the header is displayed THEN the system SHALL include all primary navigation links (Home, Discover, Analytics, Docs)
4. WHEN a user is on a specific page THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding navigation item
5. IF a page previously lacked header navigation THEN the system SHALL add the header component
6. WHEN the header is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling across all pages

7. WHEN a user hovers over menu items THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback

### Requirement 3: Documentation Section

**User Story:** As a new or existing user, I want access to help files and guides through a Docs section in the header, so that I can learn how to use the platform effectively.

6. WHEN navigation links are rendered THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing, fonts, and colors
7. WHEN the application theme changes THEN the system SHALL update navigation styling accordingly

### Requirement 5: Mobile Navigation

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a responsive navigation menu that works well on small screens, so that I can access all features comfortably on my device.

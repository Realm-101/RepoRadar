elligent User Profile - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent User Profile feature enhances RepoRadar's Pro and Enterprise tiers by providing users with personalized tools to organize, track, and discover repositories based on their preferences and activity patterns. This feature builds upon the existing basic profile functionality and subscription system to deliver a premium experience that helps users work more efficiently with GitHub repositories.

The feature consists of four core components: Bookmarks for quick access, Tags for organization, User Preferences for customization, and AI Recommendations for discovery. All backend infrastructure (database schema and storage methods) is already in place; this implementation focuses on completing the API endpoints and frontend user interface.

# Task 6: Graceful Shutdown Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive graceful shutdown handling for the RepoRadar application to ensure clean termination of all services and connections when the server receives shutdown signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT) or encounters critical errors.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Signal Handlers
**File**: `server/gracefulShutdown.ts`

Registered handlers for:
- **SIGTERM**: Standard termination signal (used by Render and other platforms)
- **SIGINT**: Interrupt signal (Ctrl+C)
- **uncaughtException**: Unhandled exceptions
- **unhandledRejection**: Unhandled promise rejections

### 2. Shutdown Sequence
The graceful shutdown follows a specific order to ensure data integrity and clean resource cleanup:

1. **WebSocket Connections** (Step 1)
   - Notify all connected clients about server shutdown
   - Send shutdown message with timestamp
   - Close all WebSocket connections gracefully
   - Close WebSocket server

2. **Job Queue** (Step 2)
   - Stop accepting new jobs
   - Wait for active BullMQ jobs to complete
   - Close worker connections
   - Ensures no data loss from in-progress background tasks

3. **HTTP Connections** (Step 3)
   - Stop accepting new HTTP connections
   - Drain existing connections (10-second grace period)
   - Force close remaining connections if timeout exceeded

4. **Cache Service** (Step 4)
   - Stop cleanup intervals
   - Clear memory cache
   - Gracefully disconnect from cache services

5. **Database Connections** (Step 5)
   - Close all database connections in the pool
   - Wait for active queries to complete
   - Release all database resources

6. **Redis Connection** (Step 6)
   - Disconnect from Redis (if enabled)
   - Close Redis client connections
   - Done last as other services may depend on it

### 3. Connection Tracking
**Implementation**: Active connection tracking

```typescript
// Track all HTTP connections
server.on('connection', (connection) => {
  this.activeConnections.add(connection);
  connection.on('close', () => {
    this.activeConnections.delete(connection);
  });
});
```

### 4. Timeout Protection
**Default Timeout**: 30 seconds (configurable)

If graceful shutdown doesn't complete within the timeout:
- Force close all remaining connections
- Exit with error code 1
- Prevents indefinite hanging

### 5. WebSocket Integration
**File**: `server/routes.ts`

Attached WebSocket server to HTTP server for shutdown access:
```typescript
(httpServer as any).wss = wss;
```

This allows the graceful shutdown handler to:
- Access the WebSocket server
- Notify connected clients
- Close connections cleanly

### 6. Service Shutdown Methods

#### Database (`server/db.ts`)
- `closePool()`: Closes the PostgreSQL connection pool
- Waits for active queries to complete
- Releases all connections

#### Cache (`server/cache.ts`)
- `shutdown()`: Stops cleanup intervals and clears memory cache
- Already implemented in previous task

#### Job Queue (`server/jobs/JobQueue.ts`)
- `close()`: Stops workers and waits for active jobs
- Already implemented with proper cleanup

#### Redis (`server/redis.ts`)
- `disconnect()`: Gracefully disconnects Redis client
- Uses `quit()` for clean shutdown, falls back to `disconnect()` if needed

## Configuration

### Server Initialization
**File**: `server/index.ts`

```typescript
gracefulShutdown.initialize(server, {
  timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
  logger: (message: string) => logger.info(message),
});
```

### Options
- `timeout`: Maximum time to wait for graceful shutdown (default: 30000ms)
- `logger`: Custom logger function (default: console.log)

## Error Handling

### Non-Blocking Errors
Each shutdown step is wrapped in try-catch to prevent one failure from blocking others:
- Logs errors but continues shutdown process
- Ensures maximum cleanup even if some services fail
- Prevents cascading failures

### Force Shutdown
If graceful shutdown fails or times out:
- Destroys all remaining connections
- Exits with error code 1
- Ensures process terminates

## Testing

### Test File
**Created**: `server/__tests__/graceful-shutdown.test.ts`

Test coverage includes:
- Signal handler registration (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Uncaught exception handlers
- Connection tracking
- Shutdown state management
- Timeout handling
- Multiple shutdown prevention

### Manual Testing
To test graceful shutdown:

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Send SIGTERM**:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   kill -TERM <pid>
   
   # Windows
   taskkill /PID <pid>
   ```

3. **Send SIGINT**:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in terminal
   ```

4. **Check logs** for shutdown sequence:
   - WebSocket connections closed
   - Job queue closed
   - Connections drained
   - Cache shutdown
   - Database closed
   - Redis disconnected

## Benefits

### 1. Zero Data Loss
- Active jobs complete before shutdown
- Database transactions finish
- No interrupted operations

### 2. Clean Resource Cleanup
- All connections properly closed
- No resource leaks
- Proper cleanup of intervals and timers

### 3. Client Notification
- WebSocket clients notified of shutdown
- Graceful disconnection messages
- Better user experience

### 4. Platform Compatibility
- Works with Render's deployment system
- Handles SIGTERM from orchestrators
- Compatible with Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

### 5. Debugging Support
- Detailed logging of shutdown process
- Tracks shutdown state
- Identifies stuck resources

## Production Considerations

### Render Deployment
- Render sends SIGTERM before stopping instances
- 30-second timeout aligns with Render's grace period
- Health checks stop passing during shutdown

### Load Balancer Behavior
- New requests routed to healthy instances
- Existing connections complete gracefully
- Zero-downtime deployments

### Monitoring
- Log shutdown events for debugging
- Track shutdown duration
- Alert on forced shutdowns (timeout exceeded)

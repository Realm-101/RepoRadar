# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying RepoRadar to production on Render. The deployment must support the full-stack application including the Express backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database (Neon), Redis caching, BullMQ job processing, and WebSocket connections. The deployment should be production-ready with proper environment configuration, health checks, monitoring, and the ability to scale.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy RepoRadar to Render, so that the application is accessible to users on the internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL serve both the API and frontend from a single service on Render
2. WHEN the deployment is configured THEN the system SHALL use the existing build process (npm run build)
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL run on the configured PORT environment variable
4. IF the deployment uses Docker THEN the system SHALL use the existing Dockerfile configuration
5. WHEN the service is created THEN the system SHALL be configured as a Web Service type on Render

### Requirement 2: Database Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect the deployed application to the Neon PostgreSQL database, so that data persists and is accessible in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects to the database THEN the system SHALL use the DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. WHEN the database connection is established THEN the system SHALL use SSL mode for secure connections
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity via health checks
4. IF database migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL support running migrations during deployment
5. WHEN connection pooling is configured THEN the system SHALL use appropriate pool settings for production load

### Requirement 3: Redis and Caching Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Redis for caching and job queues, so that the application performs optimally in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis is available THEN the system SHALL use the REDIS_URL environment variable to connect
2. IF Redis is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to in-memory caching gracefully
3. WHEN BullMQ jobs are configured THEN the system SHALL use Redis for job queue management
4. WHEN the Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue operating with degraded functionality
5. WHEN Redis is provisioned on Render THEN the system SHALL use the internal connection string for lower latency

### Requirement 4: Environment Variables and Secrets

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely configure all environment variables, so that API keys and secrets are protected in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL include all required variables from .env.example
2. WHEN secrets are stored THEN the system SHALL use Render's environment variable management
3. WHEN the GEMINI_API_KEY is configured THEN the system SHALL securely access the Google Gemini API
4. WHEN the GITHUB_TOKEN is configured THEN the system SHALL use it for higher API rate limits
5. IF Stripe is enabled THEN the system SHALL include STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
6. WHEN NODE_ENV is set THEN the system SHALL be configured as "production"
7. WHEN session secrets are configured THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random values

### Requirement 5: Health Checks and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want health checks configured, so that Render can monitor application health and restart if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks are configured THEN the system SHALL expose the /health endpoint
2. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity
3. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL verify Redis connectivity (if configured)
4. WHEN the health check fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN Render monitors the service THEN the system SHALL use the health check path for automatic restarts

### Requirement 6: Build and Start Commands

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper build and start commands configured, so that the application builds and runs correctly on Render.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command runs THEN the system SHALL execute "npm run build"
2. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL have compiled both client and server code
3. WHEN the start command runs THEN the system SHALL execute "npm run start"
4. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL run "npm ci" for reproducible builds
5. IF the build fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and show clear error messages

### Requirement 7: Static Asset Serving

**User Story:** As a developer, I want static assets served efficiently, so that the frontend loads quickly for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static files are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them from the dist/public directory
2. WHEN assets are served THEN the system SHALL include appropriate cache headers
3. WHEN compression is enabled THEN the system SHALL use gzip or brotli compression
4. WHEN the root path is accessed THEN the system SHALL serve the React application
5. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL route to Express handlers

### Requirement 8: WebSocket Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want WebSocket connections to work in production, so that real-time features function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN the system SHALL support Socket.io connections
2. WHEN multiple instances run THEN the system SHALL use Redis adapter for Socket.io (if Redis is available)
3. WHEN WebSocket upgrades are requested THEN the system SHALL handle HTTP upgrade requests properly
4. WHEN connections are established THEN the system SHALL maintain persistent connections
5. IF Redis is not available THEN the system SHALL limit to single-instance deployment for WebSocket consistency

### Requirement 9: Background Job Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want background jobs to process correctly, so that batch analysis and async tasks work in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BullMQ workers start THEN the system SHALL process jobs from Redis queues
2. WHEN jobs are queued THEN the system SHALL handle them asynchronously
3. WHEN job processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic
4. WHEN workers are running THEN the system SHALL log job processing status
5. IF Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable background job features

### Requirement 10: Scaling and Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment to support scaling, so that the application can handle increased traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling on Render
2. WHEN multiple instances run THEN the system SHALL share session state via PostgreSQL
3. WHEN load balancing is needed THEN the system SHALL work correctly behind Render's load balancer
4. WHEN instances scale THEN the system SHALL handle graceful shutdown of connections
5. WHEN performance is monitored THEN the system SHALL expose metrics via the /health endpoint

### Requirement 11: Deployment Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear deployment documentation, so that I can deploy and maintain the application easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is created THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step Render setup instructions
2. WHEN environment variables are documented THEN the system SHALL list all required and optional variables
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL include common issues and solutions
4. WHEN updates are deployed THEN the system SHALL document the deployment process
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL document how to revert to previous versions

### Requirement 12: Security Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security best practices implemented, so that the production application is secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTPS is configured THEN the system SHALL use Render's automatic SSL certificates
2. WHEN security headers are set THEN the system SHALL include HSTS, CSP, and other protective headers
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL allow requests only from the production domain
4. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL protect against abuse
5. WHEN authentication is used THEN the system SHALL use secure session configuration with httpOnly cookies

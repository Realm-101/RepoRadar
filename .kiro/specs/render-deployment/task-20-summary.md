  - Session compatibility considerations

#### 4. Rollback Verification
- **Immediate Verification** (0-5 minutes):
  - Deployment status checks
  - Health endpoint testing
  - Log review
  - Application loading verification
- **Functional Verification** (5-15 minutes):
  - Critical user flow testing
  - API endpoint testing
  - WebSocket connection verification
  - Database operation checks
- **Performance Verification** (15-30 minutes):
  - Metrics monitoring
  - Performance dashboard review
  - Slow query analysis
- **Extended Verification** (30+ minutes):
  - Error rate monitoring
  - External integration checks
  - User acceptance testing
- Complete verification checklist provided

#### 5. Emergency Rollback
- When to use emergency procedures
- 5-step emergency rollback process
- Timeline: 0-20 minutes
- Stakeholder communication templates
- Emergency rollback checklist
- Post-emergency action items

#### 6. Post-Rollback Actions
- **Immediate** (0-1 hour):
  - Incident documentation template
  - Stakeholder notification
  - Evidence preservation
- **Short-term** (1-24 hours):
  - Root cause analysis
  - Fix plan creation
  - Test improvement
- **Long-term** (1-7 days):
  - Post-mortem meeting
  - Preventive measures
  - Documentation updates
  - Team training

#### 7. Preventing Rollback Needs
- Pre-deployment testing strategies
- Staging environment best practices
- Feature flag implementation
- Gradual rollout procedures
- Blue-green deployment
- Canary deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring setup
- Automated health checks
- Code review requirements
- Database migration safety practices

#### 8. Quick Reference
- Summary of all rollback methods
- Key verification steps
- Important considerations
- Key takeaways
- Related documentation links

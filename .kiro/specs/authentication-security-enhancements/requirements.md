# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security and authentication enhancements for RepoRadar. The current authentication system has several security gaps including plaintext password storage, lack of OAuth integration, missing password reset functionality, insufficient rate limiting, and HTTP-only connections. These enhancements will bring the authentication system up to production-grade security standards while improving user experience through social login options and proper password management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Password Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my password to be securely hashed and stored, so that my account remains protected even if the database is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up with a password THEN the system SHALL hash the password using bcrypt with a minimum cost factor of 10
2. WHEN a user's password is stored in the database THEN the system SHALL store only the bcrypt hash, never the plaintext password
3. WHEN a user logs in with a password THEN the system SHALL verify the password against the stored bcrypt hash
4. WHEN the authentication system processes passwords THEN the system SHALL never log or expose plaintext passwords in any system output
5. IF a user account exists without a hashed password THEN the system SHALL require password reset on next login

### Requirement 2: OAuth Social Login Integration

**User Story:** As a developer user, I want to sign in using my Google or GitHub account through Neon/Stack Auth, so that I can quickly access the platform without managing another password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL display Google and GitHub login options
2. WHEN a user clicks the Google login button THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth flow through Stack Auth's Google provider
3. WHEN a user clicks the GitHub login button THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth flow through Stack Auth's GitHub provider
4. WHEN OAuth authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or update the user account with OAuth provider information
5. WHEN a user authenticates via OAuth THEN the system SHALL store the user's profile information (email, name, profile image) from the OAuth provider
6. IF a user's email from OAuth matches an existing account THEN the system SHALL link the OAuth provider to the existing account
7. WHEN a user has multiple auth methods THEN the system SHALL allow login through any linked method

### Requirement 3: Password Reset Flow

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it securely via email, so that I can regain access to my account without contacting support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL display a password reset request form
2. WHEN a user submits their email for password reset THEN the system SHALL generate a secure, time-limited reset token
3. WHEN a reset token is generated THEN the system SHALL send an email with a password reset link containing the token
4. WHEN a user clicks the reset link THEN the system SHALL validate the token and display a new password form
5. IF the reset token is expired (older than 1 hour) THEN the system SHALL reject the reset request and prompt for a new reset email
6. IF the reset token is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent password reset
7. WHEN a user submits a new password THEN the system SHALL hash the password with bcrypt and update the user account
8. WHEN a password reset completes successfully THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing reset tokens for that user
9. WHEN a password reset completes successfully THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email to the user

### Requirement 4: Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive rate limiting on authentication and API endpoints, so that the system is protected from abuse, brute force attacks, and excessive resource consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL limit login attempts to 5 per 15 minutes per IP address
2. WHEN a user exceeds login rate limits THEN the system SHALL return a 429 status code with retry-after information
3. WHEN a user attempts password reset THEN the system SHALL limit reset requests to 3 per hour per email address
4. WHEN authenticated API requests are made THEN the system SHALL enforce tier-based rate limits (free: 100/hour, pro: 1000/hour, enterprise: unlimited)
5. WHEN repository analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL enforce daily analysis limits based on subscription tier
6. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log the event for security monitoring
7. IF a user is rate limited THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating when they can retry
8. WHEN rate limit counters reset THEN the system SHALL use sliding window algorithm for fair distribution

### Requirement 5: HTTPS Enforcement

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all connections to use HTTPS, so that my data is encrypted in transit and protected from interception.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS for all connections
2. WHEN a user attempts to connect via HTTP in production THEN the system SHALL redirect to HTTPS
3. WHEN cookies are set THEN the system SHALL use the Secure flag in production environments
4. WHEN the application serves content THEN the system SHALL include HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers
5. WHEN session cookies are created THEN the system SHALL set SameSite attribute to prevent CSRF attacks
6. IF the application runs in development THEN the system SHALL allow HTTP connections for local testing
7. WHEN SSL/TLS is configured THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.2 or higher

### Requirement 6: Session Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to be secure and properly managed, so that my authenticated state is protected from hijacking and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL generate a new session ID to prevent session fixation
2. WHEN a user's authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL regenerate the session ID
3. WHEN sessions are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure, encrypted session storage
4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and require re-authentication
6. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL completely destroy the session and clear all session cookies
7. WHEN multiple devices are used THEN the system SHALL maintain separate sessions per device

### Requirement 7: Authentication Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and secure error messages during authentication, so that I understand what went wrong without exposing security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages that don't reveal whether the email exists
2. WHEN account lockout occurs THEN the system SHALL inform the user and provide password reset option
3. WHEN OAuth authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages and retry options
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information server-side for debugging
5. IF multiple authentication failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays
6. WHEN password requirements are not met THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which requirements failed
7. WHEN network errors occur during authentication THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms
